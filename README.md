# Hand-Action-Recognition
 This project is the upgraded version of my previously made [repo](https://github.com/SAM-DEV007/Instagram-Filters/tree/main/Hand_Gesture).

 The hand movement can be recognized in three sub-categories: `Waving`, `Stickman Walking` and `Palm to Hand` gesture. It uses webcam to record the gesture made, and calculate the appropriate action. The upgrade is in the sense, that the previous one relied on a single frame but this one relies on multiple frames (2 sec frames to be exact).

 More about preprocessing and the model can be found [here](Model/README.md).

 The window can be closed by `Q`, `Esc` or the Close button.
